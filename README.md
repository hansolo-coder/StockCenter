"# StockCenter" 

This is a stock (equities, stocks, bonds etc.) monitoring application written in PHP
Enter your purchases, sales, dividends and other changes in your portfolio.
The application will fetch the current price etc. of each equity from Yahoo showing you the current status of your investments.

This is a fork from https://sourceforge.net/projects/stockcenter/
That version was developed by David Hieber 

The original version could no longer fetch current prices etc from Yahoo due to Yahoo discontinuing that service.
This is a much updated version, where it again (at least for now :-) ) is possible to fetch prices from Yahoo, as
well as multiple other expansions, improvements and other changes.

Some screenshots etc can be seen on
